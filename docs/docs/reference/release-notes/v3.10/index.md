## Experimental: Parallel Query Running

TODO: Explanation of what it does, LMDB?, Benchmark comparison, clarification what type of sites this helps with, screenshot?

To use it and try it out, please make sure that you're using Node v14.10 or later. Install `lmdb-store` as a dependency:

```shell
npm install lmdb-store
```

Then enable the config flag in your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  flags: {
    PARALLEL_QUERY_RUNNING: true,
  },
}
```

Please share your results, findings, and feedback in the [PQR GitHub Discussion](https://gatsby.dev/pqr-feedback). You'll also be able to read about known/common pitfalls there and possible solutions.

## Experimental: webpack persistent caching for `gatsby develop`

After rolling out webpack 5 persistent caching for production builds in [Gatsby v3.8](/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.8/#webpack-caching) we're now beginning the gradual rollout of it for `gatsby develop`. It greatly improves the startup time of the development server.

To use it, add a flag to your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  flags: {
    DEV_WEBPACK_CACHE: true,
  },
}
```

If you're already using the `FAST_DEV` flag you'll be using it automatically once you update to Gatsby v3.10. Please share your feedback in the [GitHub Discussion](https://gatsby.dev/cache-clearing-feedback).
